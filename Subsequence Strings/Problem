Given two strings s1 and s2, determine if s1 is a subsequence of s2.

A string a is a subsequence of another string b if you can delete some (or 0) characters from b, 
without changing the order, and get a.

For example, ace is a subsequence of abcde, but eca is not a subsequence of abcde.

Example 1
Input

s1 = "ppl"
s2 = "apple"
Output

true
Example 2
Input

s1 = "ale"
s2 = "apple"
Output

true
Example 3
Input

s1 = "elppa"
s2 = "apple"
