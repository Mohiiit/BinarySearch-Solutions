There's a staircase with n steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Given an integer n, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters, so each different order of steps counts as a way.

Mod the result by 10 ** 9 + 7

Example 1
Input

n = 4
Output

5
Explanation

There are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
Example 2
Input

n = 1
Output

1
Explanation

There's only one way: climb up 1 step.

Example 3
Input

n = 3
Output

3
Explanation

There are three ways: [1, 1, 1], [2, 1], and [1, 2].
