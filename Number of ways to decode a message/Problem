Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message message (as a string), count the number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message 111 should return 3, since it could be decoded as aaa, ka, and ak.

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, 001 is not a valid input.

Example 1
Input

message = "111"
Output

3
Explanation

This can be decoded 3 ways: aaa, ak, and ka.

Example 2
Input

message = "8"
Output

1
Explanation

This can be only decoded one way, as h.

Example 3
Input

message = "12"
Output

2
Explanation

This can be decoded 2 ways: ab or l.
